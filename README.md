### Sorting Visualiser

A project I've always wanted to create is a visualisation of sorting algorithms. Also with the release of .NET 6, I wanted to see how far the Blazor web framework has come along. And so this sorting visualiser was created using the Blazor framework.

This project not only allows me to learn the basics of Blazor but also explore the various known/popular sorting algorithms.
