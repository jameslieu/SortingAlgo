# Sorting Visualiser

A project I've always planned to create is a visualisation of sorting algorithms when I first saw it elsewhere on the internet.

With the release of .NET 6, I wanted to see how far the Blazor web framework has come along. And so I used this as a opportunity to create this sorting visualiser using the Blazor framework.

This project not only allows me to learn the basics of Blazor but also explore the various known/popular sorting algorithms.
```
$ dotnet run --project SortingVisualiser
```
